# NHS Health Information
**Overview**

Develop a "Health Information and Service Locator" web application that provides comprehensive health-related information and assists users in locating health services. The application will utilize NHS APIs for data retrieval. A key component of this project is the implementation of JavaScript testing to ensure code reliability and functionality.

**Objectives**

Create a user-friendly and informative platform for health service information.
Implement robust JavaScript testing to ensure application reliability.
Make the application accessible and functional across various devices.

**Key Features**

Health Service Locator: Enable users to find healthcare providers and pharmacies, integrating NHS API data for detailed information.
Medication Information: Provide detailed medication information using NHS Prescribing and Pharmacy APIs.
Health Tips and News: Regularly updated health tips and news, sourced from NHS content.
Symptom Checker: A tool for basic symptom analysis with a disclaimer for professional medical advice.

**Technical Requirements**

Front-End Development: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for development with a focus on a responsive design.
API Integration: Implement NHS APIs for real-time data processing and display.
Asynchronous JavaScript: Efficiently handle API calls using async/await.

**Testing Requirements**

Unit Testing: Implement unit tests for individual components/functions using a framework like Jest or Mocha. This ensures that each part of the application works correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: Perform integration tests to verify that different parts of the application work together as expected.
End-to-End Testing: Use tools like Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing to simulate real user scenarios and ensure the application behaves correctly from start to finish.
Test Coverage: Aim for a high level of test coverage, ensuring most of the codebase is tested.

**Additional Considerations**

User Experience: Prioritize intuitive navigation and ease of use.
Data Privacy: Adhere to data protection regulations and best practices in handling user data.
Scalability: Design the application with potential future enhancements in mind.

**Deliverables**

A fully functional web application with the specified features.
Comprehensive test suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Documentation including a user guide, codebase annotations, and technical specifications.
A presentation showcasing application features and the development and testing process.
